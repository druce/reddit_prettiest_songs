    "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (/ˈstɛfəni ˌdʒɜːrməˈnɒtə/ (listen) STEF-ən-ee JUR-mə-NOT-ə; born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her image reinventions and versatility in the entertainment industry. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The album was later reissued to include the extended play The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\", and \"Alejandro\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga's five succeeding albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first week. The title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), and its lead single \"Applause\", Gaga released the jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and the soft rock album Joanne (2016). She ventured into acting, winning awards for her leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016) and the musical film A Star Is Born (2018). Her contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single \"Shallow\", made her the first woman to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to dance-pop with her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single \"Rain on Me\". She both released her second collaborative album with Bennett, Love for Sale, and starred in the biopic House of Gucci in 2021.\n",

    "Life and career\n",
    "1986–2004: Early life\n",
    "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City,[1] to an upper middle class Catholic family. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry.[2] Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta,[3] and she has a younger sister named Natali.[4] Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything.[5][6] From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school.[7] Gaga has described her high-school self as \"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\" but also \"a bit insecure\". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for \"being either too provocative or too eccentric\".[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become \"a cultured young woman\". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which Gaga preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp.[9] As a teenager, she played at open mic nights.[10] Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in the play Guys and Dolls and Philia in the play A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Regis High School.[11] She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years.[12] Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though did appear in a small background role as a high-school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled \"The Telltale Moozadell\".[13][14] She later said of her inclination towards music:\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at.[15]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts, and lived in an NYU dorm. She studied music there, and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst.[16][17] In 2005, Gaga withdrew from school during the second semester of her second year to focus on her music career.[18] That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2014 interview, Gaga said she had been raped at age 19, and later underwent mental and physical therapy for this.[20] She has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attributes it to the incident, and has credited support from doctors, family and friends with helping her.[21] Gaga later gave additional details about the rape, including that \"the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner at my parents' house because I was vomiting and sick. Because I'd been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months.\"[22]\n",
    "\n",
    "2005–2007: Career beginnings\n",
    "In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop artist Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park.[23] She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU.[11][24] They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene.[11] After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at the Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari.[25] Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material.[26] The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her \"Lady Gaga\", which was derived from Queen's song \"Radio Ga Ga\".[27] Their relationship lasted until January 2007.[28]\n",

    "Fusari and Gaga established a company called \"Team Lovechild, LLC\" to promote her career.[27] They recorded and produced electropop tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of Artists and repertoire (A&R) at Def Jam Recordings, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006.[29][30] She was dropped from the label three months later[31] and returned to her family home for Christmas. Gaga began performing at neo-burlesque shows, which according to her represented freedom.[32] During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped mold her onstage persona.[33] The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge, the Bitter End, and the Rockwood Music Hall. Their live performance art piece, known as \"Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue\" and billed as \"The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow\", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts.[34][35] They performed at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival.[34]\n",
    "\n",
    "Having initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock style of David Bowie and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and record executive Vincent Herbert.[36] In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records, established that month.[37] Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her.[38] Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing, Gaga struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears, New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and the Pussycat Dolls.[39] At Interscope, musician Akon was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio.[40] Akon convinced Jimmy Iovine, chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M Records (a brother company for Def Jam), to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label KonLive, making her his \"franchise player\".[31][41]\n",
    "\n",
    "In late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne.[42] She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum.[39] Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too \"racy\", \"dance-oriented\", and \"underground\" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: \"My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next.\"[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "2008–2010: Breakthrough with The Fame and The Fame Monster\n",
    "By 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's The Factory.[43][44] The Fame was released on August 19, 2008,[45] and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US.[46][47] Its first two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\",[48] reached number one in the United States,[49] Australia,[50] Canada[51] and the UK.[52] The latter was also the world's best-selling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart.[53][54] Three other singles, \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", \"LoveGame\" and \"Paparazzi\", were released from the album;[55] the lattermost reached number one in Germany.[56] Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", were included on Hitmixes in August 2009.[57] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, The Fame and \"Poker Face\" won Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively.[58]\n",

    "In February 2020, Gaga began a relationship with entrepreneur Michael Polansky.[226] Her sixth studio album, Chromatica, was released on May 29, 2020, to positive reviews.[227][228] It debuted atop the US charts, becoming her sixth consecutive number-one album in the country, and reached the top spot in more than a dozen other territories including Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK.[229] Chromatica was preceded by two singles, \"Stupid Love\", on February 28, 2020,[230] and \"Rain on Me\", with Ariana Grande, on May 22.[231] The latter won the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, and debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the third person to top the country's chart in the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.[232][233] At the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga won five awards, including the inaugural Tricon Award recognizing artists accomplished in different areas of the entertainment industry.[234] In September 2020, she appeared in the video campaign for Valentino's Voce Viva fragrance, singing a stripped-down version of Chromatica track \"Sine from Above\", along with a group of models.[235]\n",

    "During the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021, Gaga sang the US national anthem.[237] In February 2021, her dog walker Ryan Fischer was hospitalized after getting shot in Hollywood. Two of her French Bulldogs, Koji and Gustav, were taken while a third dog named Miss Asia escaped and was subsequently recovered by police. Gaga later offered a $500,000 reward for the return of her pets.[238][239] Two days later, on February 26, a woman brought the dogs to a police station in Los Angeles. Both were unharmed. Los Angeles Police initially said the woman who dropped off the dogs did not appear to be involved with the shooting,[240] but on April 29, she was one of five people charged in connection with the shooting and theft.[241] In December 2022, James Howard Jackson, the man who shot Fischer, was sentenced to 21 years in prison.[242]\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2021, Gaga teamed up with Champagne brand Dom Pérignon, and appeared in an ad shot by Nick Knight.[243] On September 3, she released her third remix album, Dawn of Chromatica.[244] This was followed by her second collaborative album with Tony Bennett, titled Love for Sale, on September 30.[245] The record received generally favorable reviews, and debuted at number eight in the US.[246][247] The album's promotional rollout included the television special One Last Time: An Evening with Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, released in November 2021, on CBS, which featured select performances from the duo's August 3 and 5 performances at Radio City Music Hall.[248][249] Another taped performance by the duo recorded for MTV Unplugged was released that December.[250] At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Love for Sale won Gaga and Bennett the award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.[251]\n",

    "After an appearance in the television special Friends: The Reunion, in which Gaga sang \"Smelly Cat\" with Lisa Kudrow,[252] she portrayed Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of hiring a hitman to murder her ex-husband and former head of the Gucci fashion house Maurizio Gucci (played by Adam Driver), in Ridley Scott's biographical crime film titled House of Gucci.[253][254] For the part, Gaga learned to speak with an Italian accent. She also stayed in character for 18 months, speaking with an accent for nine months during that period.[255] Her method acting approach took a toll on her mental wellbeing, and towards the end of filming she had to be accompanied on-set by a psychiatric nurse.[256] The film was released on November 24, 2021, to mixed reviews, though critics praised Gaga's performance as \"note-perfect\".[257] She earned the New York Film Critics Circle Award, and nominations for the BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress.[258] Gaga co-wrote the song \"Hold My Hand\" for the 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick,[259] and also composed the score alongside Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer.[260] She performed \"Hold My Hand\" live at the 95th Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Original Song.[261] The track also earned Gaga her third win for Best Original Song at the Satellite Awards.[262] In July 2022, she embarked on The Chromatica Ball stadium tour,[263] which had twenty dates and grossed $112.4 million from 834,000 tickets sold.[236] By the end of the year, she became the highest grossing female artist touring in 2022.[264]\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2023, Gaga was appointed as co-chair of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities by President Joe Biden.[265] A documentary called The Lady and the Legend, which will include footage from the making of Gaga and Tony Bennett's two collaborative albums and \"chronicles their 10-year relationship\", will be available exclusively on Paramount+ in September 2023.[249][266] Gaga is set to star with Joaquin Phoenix in Joker: Folie à Deux, which will be released in 2024.[267]\n",

    "Musicians such as Madonna and David Bowie have influenced Gaga.\n",
    "Gaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson,[268] the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston,[269] Elton John, Prince,[270][271] En Vogue, TLC,[272] Christina Aguilera,[273] Janet Jackson,[274] and Blondie,[275] who have all influenced her music.[276] Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater.[31][277] She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga.[278] Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has.[279] Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson.[280][281][282][283] She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.[284]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music.[18][285] Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher;[286][287] she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own.[287] Gaga became friends with British fashion designer Alexander McQueen shortly before his suicide in 2010, and became known for wearing his designs, particularly his towering armadillo shoes.[93][288] She considers fashion designer Donatella Versace her muse; Versace has called Lady Gaga \"the fresh Donatella\".[289][290] Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since her childhood.[291]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga has called the Indian alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra a \"true inspiration\",[292] and has also quoted Indian leader Osho's book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality.[293]\n",
    "\n",
    "Musical style and themes\n",
    "Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is \"liberating\" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood.[294] Gaga combines a variety of music genres, particularly incorporating elements of rock into her pop and dance music. She has also branched out into jazz and other non-pop musical genres.[295] Gaga is a contralto, with a range spanning from B♭2 to B5.[296][297][298] She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers Born This Way \"much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of\".[299][300] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power.\"[301]\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Evan Sawdey of PopMatters, Gaga \"manage[s] to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace\".[302] Gaga believes that \"all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit\".[303] Simon Reynolds wrote in 2010, \"Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&B-ish beats.\"[304]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while the follow-up The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop,[305] whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on \"Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q\".[306] Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism.[307] The album explores new genres, such as electronic rock and techno.[308]\n",
    "\n",
    "The themes in Artpop revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny.[309] Billboard describes Artpop as \"coherently channeling R&B, techno, disco and rock music\".[310] With Cheek to Cheek, Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre.[311] Joanne, exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life.[312] The A Star Is Born soundtrack contains elements of blues rock, country and bubblegum pop.[210] Billboard says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as \"timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener.\"[313] On Chromatica, Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots, and discussed her struggles with mental health.[314] Her second album with Tony Bennett, Love for Sale, consists of a tribute to Cole Porter.[315]\n",

    "Gaga during a \"blood soaked\" performance in 2010\n",
    "Featuring constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films.[316] The video for \"Telephone\" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video.[317] According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores bondage and sadomasochism and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She calls herself \"a little bit of a feminist\" and asserts that she is \"sexually empowering women\".[318] Billboard ranked her sixth on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time\" in 2020, stating that \"the name 'Lady Gaga' will forever be synonymous with culture-shifting music videos\".[319]\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarded as \"one of the greatest living musical performers\" by Rolling Stone,[320] Gaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows.[321] Her performances have been described as \"highly entertaining and innovative\";[322] the blood-spurting performance of \"Paparazzi\" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as \"eye-popping\" by MTV News.[323] She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the Cumbria shootings, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself.[324] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga appeared in drag as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song \"You and I\".[325] As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant Richard Jackson in 2014.[326]\n",
    "\n",
    "In an October 2018 article for Billboard, Rebecca Schiller traced back Gaga's videography from \"Just Dance\" to the release of A Star Is Born. Schiller noted that following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne, taking the example of the music video of lead single \"Perfect Illusion\" where she eschewed \"the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party\". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.[327] Reviewing The Chromatica Ball in 2022, Chris Willman of Variety wrote that Gaga \"could have further played the authenticity card for all it's worth\" after the release of Joanne and A Star Is Born, but instead \"has determined to keep herself weird — or just weird enough to provide necessarily ballast to her more earnest inclinations\".[328]\n",

    "Public reception of her music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled \"Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame\" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling \"some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga\".[330] When Gaga met briefly with then-president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction \"intimidating\" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room.[331] When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny.[332]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character.[286][289] During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of Christina Aguilera.[289] In 2011, 121 women gathered at the Grammy Awards dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators.[95] The Global Language Monitor named \"Lady Gaga\" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark \"no pants\" a close third.[333] Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade \"best-of\" list, saying that she \"brought performance art into the mainstream\".[334] People ranked her number one on their \"Best Dressed Stars of 2021\" list, writing that Gaga \"strutted the streets in high-fashion designs, from a sculptural seersucker number to a black lace corseted gown—accessorizing each with elegant updos, sky-high heels and retro shades—like it was no sweat.\"[335]\n",
    "\n",
    "Time placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list, stating: \"Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits ... [Gaga] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat.\"[336] Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef.[337] Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year.[338][339] It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization PETA found it offensive.[340] The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012,[341] and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.[342]\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaga's fans call her \"Mother Monster\", and she often refers to them as \"Little Monsters\", a phrase she had tattooed on herself in dedication.[343] In his article \"Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It\" for Vice, Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-brandings, such as those of Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Justin Bieber.[344] In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the social networking service LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans.[345] Scott Hardy, CEO of Polaroid, praised Gaga for inspiring fans and for her close interactions with them on social media.[346]\n",
    "\n",
    "Censorship\n",
    "In 2011, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China acting on behalf of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, banned Gaga for \"being vulgar.\"[347] The ban was lifted in 2014. However, conditions for Artpop to go on sale legally in China were placed on the album artwork, covering her almost naked body. Officials also changed the title of the song \"Sexxx Dreams\" to \"X Dreams.\"[348]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Gaga was banned in China again after she publicly talked with the Dalai Lama.[349][350] The Chinese government added Gaga to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop distributing her songs. The Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting.[351] In the following years, Gaga's image was blacked out in reporting of the 91st Academy Awards in China and her appearance was cut from Friends: The Reunion; both incidents received backlash from her Chinese fans.[352][353]\n",

    "Philanthropy\n",
    "After declining an invitation to appear on the single \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", because of rehearsals for her tour, to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund.[354] All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund.[355] Hours after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts;[356] these raised $1.5 million.[357] In June 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross.[358]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group Artists Against Fracking.[359] That October, Yoko Ono gave Gaga and four other activists the LennonOno Grant for Peace in Reykjavík, Iceland.[360] The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes in the fight against HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam.[361] Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.[362]\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to support Biden's It's On Us campaign as he traveled to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activism.[363] Two months later, Gaga attended the 84th Annual US Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis where she joined with the Dalai Lama to talk about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place.[364]\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2020, Gaga curated the televised benefit concert, One World: Together at Home, a collaboration with Global Citizen to benefit the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[365][366] The special raised $127 million, which according to Forbes \"puts it on par with the other legendary fundraiser, Live Aid, as the highest grossing charity concert in history.\"[367] In recognition of her contribution to the Black Lives Matter movement, Gaga received the Yolanda Denise King High Ground Award from the King Center's Beloved Community Awards in January 2021. In her acceptance speech, she denounced racism and white supremacy and addressed her social responsibility as a high-profile artist and white woman.[368]\n",

Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the foundation's inauguration at Harvard University.[369] The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York.[370] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot, which donated 25% of the sales, a minimum of $1 million of a series of limited edition back-to-school products.[371] The foundation's initiatives have included the \"Born Brave Bus\" that followed her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying.[372][373]\n",

    "In March 2019, she penned a letter to supporters of the Born This Way Foundation, announcing the launch of a new pilot program for a teen mental health first aid project with the National Council for Behavioral Health. Gaga revealed her personal struggles with mental health in her letter and how she was able to get support which saved her life: \"I know what it means to have someone support me and understand what I'm going through, and every young person in the world should have someone to turn to when they're hurting. It saved my life, and it will save theirs.\"[380][381] In September 2020, Gaga released an anthology book, Channel Kindness: Stories of Kindness and Community, featuring fifty-one stories about kindness, bravery, and resilience from young people all over the world collected by the Born This Way Foundation, and introduced by herself.[382] She had been promoting it with a 21 days of kindness challenge on her social media, using the \"BeKind21\" hashtag.[383] In 2021, Gaga collaborated with the Champagne house Dom Pérignon to release a limited edition of Rosé Vintage 2005 bottles along with a sculpture designed by her.

Rodemeyer's suicide prompted Gaga to meet with then-President Barack Obama in order to address anti-gay bullying in American schools.[396] In 2011, she was also ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends.[397]\n",

    "According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, \"Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project.\"[416] Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield considers it \"hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it was a lot more boring\".[417] In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had \"practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle\".[418] A 2017 journal published by Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts studying structural patterns in melodies of earworm songs compiled lists of catchiest tracks from 3,000 participants, in which Gaga's \"Bad Romance\", \"Alejandro\", and \"Poker Face\" ranked number one, eight, and nine, respectively.[419] In 2018, NPR named her the second most influential female artist of the 21st century, noting her as \"one of the first big artists of the 'Internet age'\".[420] Gaga and her work have influenced various artists including Miley Cyrus,[421] Nicki Minaj,[422] Ellie Goulding,[423] Halsey,[424] Jennifer Lopez,[425] Beyoncé,[426] Nick Jonas,[427] Sam Smith,[428] Noah Cyrus,[429] Katherine Langford,[430] MGMT,[431] Allie X,[432] Greyson Chance,[433] Cardi B,[434] Rina Sawayama,[435] Blackpink,[436] Madison Beer,[437] Ren,[438] Slayyyter,[439] Bebe Rexha,[440] Bree Runway,[441] Celeste,[442] Kim Petras,[443] Jojo Siwa,[444] Pabllo Vittar,[445] Ava Max,[446] Doja Cat,[447] Chaeyoung of Twice,[448] Kanye West,[449] Rachel Zegler,[450] SZA,[451] Raye,[452] and Grace Gaustad.[453]\n",
    "\n",
    "A new genus of ferns, Gaga, and three species, G. germanotta, G. monstraparva and Kaikaia gaga, have been named in her honor. The name monstraparva alluded to Gaga's fans, known as Little Monsters, since their symbol is the outstretched \"monster claw\" hand, which resembles a tightly rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling.[454][455] Gaga also has an extinct mammal, Gagadon minimonstrum,[456] and a parasitic wasp, Aleiodes gaga, named for her.[457][458]\n",
    "\n",
    "In Taichung, Taiwan, July 3 is designated as \"Lady Gaga Day\" marking the first day Gaga visited the country in 2011.[459] In May 2021, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Born This Way and its cultural impact, West Hollywood mayor, Lindsey P. Horvath, presented a key to the city to Gaga and declared May 23 as \"Born This Way Day.\" A street painting with the Daniel Quasar's version of the pride flag featuring the album's title was also unveiled on Robertson Boulevard as a tribute to the album, and how it has inspired the LGBT community over the years.[460]\n",

    "\n",
    "According to Guinness World Records, she was the most followed person on Twitter from 2011 to 2013,[484] the most famous celebrity in 2013,[485] and the most powerful popstar in 2014.[486] She was included on Forbes' Celebrity 100 from 2010 to 2015 and then from 2018 to 2020, having topped the list in 2011. She earned $62 million, $90 million, $52 million, $80 million, $33 million, and $59 million from 2010 through 2015, and $50 million, $39 million and $38 million between 2018 and 2020.[487][488] Gaga also appeared on their list of the World's Most Powerful Women from 2010 to 2014.[489][490] She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010 and 2019,[491][492] and ranked second in its most influential people of the past ten years readers' poll in 2013.[493]\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard's list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour.[494] The following year, she topped Forbes' List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30,[488] which she also topped in 2011,[495] and in February 2016, the magazine estimated her net worth to be $275 million.[496] In December 2019, Gaga placed 10th on Forbes' list of Top-Earning Musicians of the Decade with earnings of $500 million in the 2010s.
